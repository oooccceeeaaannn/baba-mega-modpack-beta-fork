# Baba Is You - The MEGA MODPACK (UNOFFICIAL Beta branch)

This...... is a big one. A **BIG** modpack that merges several (curated) Baba Is You mods from various people into one GIANT (mostly working) MODPACK.

## But first, a (serious) disclaimer...
I am not motivated AT ALL to maintain the UNOFFICIAL Beta branch of the Mega Modpack. Therefore, expect it to rarely update. (Like, maybe a 10-year hiatus.)

## Alright, serious time over! Where are the goods?!

# How to install
1. This modpack only works when you install into a levelpack. Pick an existing levelpack or create a new levelpack in the baba editor. (From baba title: `Level Editor -> Edit Levelpacks -> Create a new levelpack`)
    - Note that when installing a mod into a levelpack, the mod will only take effect within the levelpack itself.
2. Close the game and navigate to `<Baba game directory>\Data\Worlds\<world folder>`
    - If you created a new levelpack, `<world folder>` will most likely be named something like `63World`. To determine which folder is your levelpack, look in each folder for a `world_data.txt` file. Inside it, look for whatever you named your levelpack under `[General]`.
3. Edit `world_data.txt` and add `mods=1` underneath the `[General]` section.
    - `mods` will not be seen if you haven't configured your levelpack to enable modding.
4. Copy both `Lua` and `Sprites` folder to the levelpack folder. This should add the contents of `Sprites` to the one in the levelpack folder and also create (or update) the `Lua` folder in the levelpack.
5. And thats it! You can start baba again and navigate to the levelpack and start playing around.
